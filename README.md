# EXPerience restore plugin
Since there is a bug in multipaper cause player's EXP lost after death,
I code this plugin to backup your EXP data so your EXP will be restored 
after death
# how to use 
just need to put them into your plugin folder then the 
plugin will generate a config.yml you need to create a SQLdatabase first
then enter the SQL information into config.yml

# caution!
If your server is not a new server you need to insert the player 
data on your own else the plugin will not working for the certain players
